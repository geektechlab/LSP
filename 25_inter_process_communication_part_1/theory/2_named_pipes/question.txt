What are the advantages of using named pipe over unnamed pipe?
=================================================================

Named pipes (fifo) have the below advantages:

	--->	you don't have to start the reading/writing processes at the same time

	--->	you can have multiple readers/writers which do not need common ancestry

	--->	as a file you can control ownership and permissions
