What is a pipe
==================

We use the term pipe to mean connecting a data flow from one process to another. Generally you attach or pipe the output of one process to the input of another.

For shell commands, this is done using the pipe character to join the commands
	$ command1 | command2

1. The standard input to command1 will comes from the terminal keyboard
2. The standard output from command1 is fed to command2 as its standard input
3. The standard output from command2 is connected to the terminal screen.

A pipe is created by calling the pipe function.

#include <unistd.h>
int pipe(int fd[2]);

Returns: 0 if OK, âˆ’1 on error

	--> pipe is passed (a pointer to) an array of two integer file descriptors. 
	--> it fills the array with two new file descriptors and returns a zero.
	--> The two file descriptors returned are connected in a special way.
	--> Any data written to file_descriptor[1] can be read back from file_descriptor[0].
	--> The first element of the array is the reading-end of the pipe, the second is the writing end.
