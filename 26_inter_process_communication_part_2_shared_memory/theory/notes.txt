Both System V IPC (XSI IPC) and POSIX IPC including three different mechanisms for inter-processes communication:

	Message queues : pass messages between processes

	Semaphores : synchronize for multiple processes by kernel

	Shared memory: share region of memory

POSIX IPC has the following general advantages when compared to System V IPC:
===============================================================================
	The POSIX IPC interface is simpler than the System V IPC interface.

	The POSIX IPC model—the use of names instead of keys, and the open, close , and unlink functions—is more consistent with the traditional UNIX file model.

	POSIX IPC objects are reference counted. This simplifies object deletion, because we can unlink a POSIX IPC object, knowing that it will be destroyed only when all processes have closed it.
