Shared Memory Objects and Linux Kernels
=======================================

On Linux, all shared memory objects can be found in /dev/shm

You may list them with ls -l /dev/shm. 

You may also remove a shared memory object with rm /dev/shm/[name]

Since Linux 3.16, the kernel supports unlimited shared memory size.

$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
18446744073692774399

If the system administrator did not change the limit, then it is ULONG_MAX - (1 << 24) (i.e. 18014398509465599 on 64-bit machines), which stands for unlimited. 

Of course, this is the theoretical upper bound. The physical RAM size and SWAP size may impose other limits.
