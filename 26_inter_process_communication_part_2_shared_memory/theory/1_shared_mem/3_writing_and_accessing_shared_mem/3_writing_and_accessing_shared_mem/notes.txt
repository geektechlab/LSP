mmap, munmap
============

mmap, munmap - map or unmap files or devices into memory

 void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
                  int fd, off_t offset);

 int munmap(void *addr, size_t length);

  mmap()  creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling process.

  addr -- the starting address for the new mapping. If NULL, the kernel chooses the address at which to create the mapping

  length -- specifies the length of the mapping

  prot -- describes the memory protection of the mapping

		
	PROT_EXEC  Pages may be executed.

       PROT_READ  Pages may be read.

       PROT_WRITE Pages may be written.

       PROT_NONE  Pages may not be accessed

  flags -- determines whether updates to the mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same region

	MAP_SHARED  	Share  this  mapping
	MAP_PRIVATE	Create a private copy-on-write mapping.
