What is a process's signal disposition?
===========================================

For each process, each signal has a disposition which means what action will occur when a signal is delivered to the process.

For example, the default disposition SIGINT is to terminate it.

The signal disposition can be changed by calling signal() or sigaction()

The default disposition for signals can be to
	ignore the signal
	stop the process,
	continue a stopped process
	terminate the process
	or terminate the process and also dump a 'core' file

Note a core file is a representation of the processes' memory state that can be inspected using a debugger.
