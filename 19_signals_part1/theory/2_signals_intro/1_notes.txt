killall -SIGSEGV ./1

explore some of the more esoteric signals and see similar results occur when the program terminates

killall -SIGPWR ./1

killall -SIGSTOP ./1

If we were to run jobs, we can see that ./1 is stopped in the background. This is the same as typing Ctrl-z in the terminal.

killall -SIGCONT ./1

And, after we run jobs, the loop program is running in the background:

The Ctrl-c from the terminal actually generates the SIGINT signal, which stands for "interrupt" because a Ctrl-c initiates an interrupt of the foreground process, which by default terminates the process.

killall -SIGINT ./1
