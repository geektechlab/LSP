If we were to run this program, it does mostly what you expect:

Ok, now consider if we were to provide input that doesn't fit this model. What if we were to provide shell commands as input.

./inject_system 
What input do you want to 'cat' (choose from below)
input > ;echo
Executing: /bin/cat ./;echo
/bin/cat: ./: Is a directory

The input we provided was ";echo" the semi-colon closes off a bash command alowing a new one to start. Notice that there is an extra new line printed, that was the echo printing. Now, can we get this program to run something more interesting?

We still have the cat program we wrote that prints "Goodbye World" and the PATH is set up to look in the local directory.
