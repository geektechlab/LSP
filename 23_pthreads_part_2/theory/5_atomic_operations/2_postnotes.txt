The above code suffers from a race condition - the value of i is changing. The new threads start later (in the example output the last thread starts after the loop has finished).

To overcome this race-condition, we will give each thread a pointer to it's own data area.

These are synchronization locks that are used to prevent race conditions and ensure proper synchronization between threads running in the same program
