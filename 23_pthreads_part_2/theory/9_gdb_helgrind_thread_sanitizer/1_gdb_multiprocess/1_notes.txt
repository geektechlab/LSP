Debugging programs with multiple processes
=============================================
On Linux, if you want to debug both the parent and child processes, use the command set detach-on-fork.

Syntax: set detach-on-fork mode

Tells gdb whether to detach one of the processes after a fork, or retain debugger control over them both.

on
	The child process (or parent process, depending on the value of follow-fork-mode) will be detached and allowed to run independently. This is the default.

off
	Both processes will be held under the control of GDB. One process (child or parent, depending on the value of follow-fork-mode) is debugged as usual, while the other is held suspended.

show detach-on-fork
	Show whether detach-on-fork mode is on/off.

If you choose to set ‘detach-on-fork’ mode off, then GDB will retain control of all forked processes 

You can list the forked processes under the control of GDB by using the info inferiors command, and switch from one fork to another by using the inferior command

To quit debugging one of the forked processes, you can either detach from it by using the detach inferiors command (allowing it to run independently)
