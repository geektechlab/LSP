Debugging programs with multiple processes
=============================================

GDB provides support for debugging programs that create additional processes using the fork or vfork function.

By default, when a program forks, GDB will continue to debug the parent process and the child process will run unchecked

If you want to follow the child process instead of the parent process, use the command set follow-fork-mode. 

Syntax:
=======

set follow-fork-mode parent
set follow-fork-mode child
show follow-fork-mode
Default mode:-
The default value for the follow-fork-mode setting is 'parent'.
