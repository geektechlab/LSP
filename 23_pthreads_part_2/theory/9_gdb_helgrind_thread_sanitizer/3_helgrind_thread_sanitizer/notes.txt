Helgrind
=============

Helgrind is a Valgrind tool for detecting synchronisation errors in C, C++ and Fortran programs that use the POSIX pthreads threading primitives.

Helgrind can detect three classes of errors
	1.Misuses of the POSIX pthreads API.

	2.Potential deadlocks arising from lock ordering problems.

	3.Data races -- accessing memory without adequate locking or synchronisation.
