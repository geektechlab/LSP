Attributes
===========

Attributes are a way to specify behavior that is different from the default.

When a thread is created with pthread_create() an attribute object can be specified. 

Note: however that the default atributes are usually sufficient for most applications.

Important Note: Attributes are specified only at thread creation time; they cannot be altered while the thread is being used.

Thus three functions are usually called in tandem

Thread attibute intialisation -- pthread_attr_init() create a default pthread_attr_t tattr
Thread attribute value change (unless defaults appropriate) -- a variety of pthread_attr_*() functions are available to set individual attribute values for the pthread_attr_t tattr structure. (see below).
Thread creation -- a call to pthread_create() with approriate attribute values set in a pthread_attr_t tattr structure.

Attributes include:
=====================
Detached or joinable state
Scheduling inheritance
Scheduling policy
Scheduling parameters
Scheduling contention scope
Stack size

Stack guard (overflow) size
