If I lock a mutex, does it stop all other threads?
====================================================

No, the other threads will continue. It's only when a thread attempts to lock a mutex that is already locked, will the thread have to wait

Can I create mutex before fork-ing?
===================================

Yes - however the child and parent process will not share virtual memory and each one will have a mutex independent of the other.

If one thread locks a mutex can another thread unlock it?
=========================================================

No. The same thread must unlock it.
