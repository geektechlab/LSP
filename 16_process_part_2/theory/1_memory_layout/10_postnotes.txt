malloc is NOT calling brk each time we call it.

The first time, malloc creates a new space (the heap) for the program (by increasing the program break location).

The following times, malloc uses the same space to give our program "new" chunks of memory. 

Those "new" chunks of memory are part of the memory previously allocated using brk

This way, malloc doesn't have to use syscalls (brk) every time we call it, and thus it makes malloc - and our programs using malloc - faster. It also allows malloc and free to optimize the usage of the memory.
