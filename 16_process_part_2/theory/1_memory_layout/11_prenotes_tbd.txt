The 0x10 lost bytes
=====================

If we look at the output of the previous program 

we can see that the first memory address returned by malloc doesn't start at the beginning of the heap, but 0x10 bytes  after

0x1314010 vs 0x1314000

Also, when we call malloc(1024) a second time, the address should be 0x1314010 (the returned value of the first call to malloc) + 1024 (or 0x400 in hexadecimal, since the first call to malloc was asking for 1024 bytes) = 0x1318010

 But the return value of the second call to malloc is 0x1314420.

We have lost 0x10 bytes again! Same goes for the subsequent calls
