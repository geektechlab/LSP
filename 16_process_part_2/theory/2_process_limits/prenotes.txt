Every process has a set of resource limits, some of which can be queried and changed by the getrlimit and setrlimit functions

#include <sys/resource.h>
int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlptr);
int setrlimit(int resource, const struct rlimit *rlptr);

Both return: 0 if OK, âˆ’1 on error

Each call to these two functions specifies a single resource and a pointer to the following structure:
struct rlimit {
	rlim_t rlim_cur; /* soft limit: current limit */
	rlim_t rlim_max; /* hard limit: maximum value for rlim_cur */
};

Three rules govern the changing of the resource limits.
1. A process can change its soft limit to a value less than or equal to its hard limit.
2. A process can lower its hard limit to a value greater than or equal to its soft limit. This lowering of the hard limit is irreversible for normal users.
3. Only a superuser process can raise a hard limit.
