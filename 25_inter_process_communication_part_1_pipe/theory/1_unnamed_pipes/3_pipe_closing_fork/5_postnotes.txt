The mistake in above code is that there is still a reader for the pipe! The child still has the pipe's first file descriptor open 

When forking, It is common practice to close the unnecessary (unused) end of each pipe in the child and parent process. 

For example the parent might close the reading end and the child might close the writing end (and vice versa if you have two pipes)
