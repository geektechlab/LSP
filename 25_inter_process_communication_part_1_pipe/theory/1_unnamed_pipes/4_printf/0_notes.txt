Want to use pipes with printf and scanf? Use fdopen!
======================================================

POSIX file descriptors are simple integers 0,1,2,3...

At the C library level, C wraps these with a buffer and useful functions like printf and scanf, so we that we can easily print or parse integers, strings etc. 

If you already have a file descriptor then you can 'wrap' it yourself into a FILE pointer using fdopen
