Theory0:
What is GDB?
================

GDB stands for GNU DeBugger which helps you to debug your binary object file created in compilation process.

GDB allows to you see what is happening in your program which really helps much when program crashes, especially when segmentation fault occurs

Some uses of gdb:
==================
	Step through a program line by line

	Set breakpoints that will stop your program

	Make your program stop on specified conditions

	Show the present values of variables

	Examine the contents of any frame on the call stack

Languages supported by GDB 
===========================
Ada, Assembly, C, C++, D, Fortran, Go, Objective-C, OpenCL, Modula-2, Pascal, Rust 

Install gdb
==============

$ sudo apt-get install gdb
$ gdb --version

Theory1:
How to compile a program to use with gdb
========================================

$ gcc -g -o binaryfile source_code.c

-g tells the compiler to store symbol table information in the executable.

this includes:
	--> symbol names
	--> type info for symbols
	--> files and line numbers where the symbols came from

Tip: Check the size of binary with and without debugging symbols ( [ gcc -g -o binaryfile source_code.c ] vs [ gcc -o binaryfile source_code.c ] )

$ gdb ./binaryfile

or

$ gdb

(gdb) file path_to_binary

GDB is a command line interface.
This means you will be provided with a prompt at which you can type commands.

The GDB commandline looks like this:

(gdb)

Basic Commands
=================

This starts the program which you want to debug. 
(gdb)run

To exit GDB, use the quit command (abbreviated q) or type an end-of-file character (usually Ctrl-d).

(gdb)quit

The "-q" (or "--quiet") option on the command line just tells GDB not to print version information on startup. 
(gdb)quiet


Help
====================

If you’re ever confused about a command or just want more information, use the “help” command, with or without an argument:

(gdb) help [command]

-------------
To look more detailed version, check bare metal repo scripts and try executing on STM32.

Theory2:
The whole purpose of coming to gdb was to pause, observe and proceed. 

There is no point in running a program without a breakpoint! 

Breakpoints
=================

Breakpoints can be used to stop the program run in the middle, at a designated point.

Whenever gdb gets to a breakpoint it halts execution of your program and allows you to examine it

Simplest way of putting a breakpoint is using the function name or a line number.

(gdb) break factorial 
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400538: file source_code.c, line 5.

(gdb) break 7
Breakpoint 2 at 0x400545: file source_code.c, line 7.

List of functions available
========================================

(gdb) info functions 

List of breakpoints available
================================

(gdb) info breakpoints 

Run the program and it will stop at the first breakpoint

(gdb) r

Delete Breakpoints
==========================

(gdb) delete <bpnumber>

Disable/Enable Breakpoints
===========================

(gdb) disable <bpnumber>

(gdb) enable <bpnumber>

Step by step
==============

Once you have hit a breakpoint, you can have fine control over the execution of the program, using the following commands

(gdb) continue

Continue execution till the next break point or end of program

Typing 'run' again instead of 'continue' would restart the program from the beginning.

(gdb) next

Proceed to the next line of execution (Doesn’t step into a function call in the current line)

(gdb) step

The same as next, but with difference that if you are at a function call
	next -  the function will execute and return
	step - step into the first line of the called function.

(gdb) finish
	Finish executing the current function, then pause (also called step out). Useful if you accidentally stepped into a function.


(gdb) print n

The print command prints the value of the variable specified

(gdb) print/x n
Prints the value in hexadecimal

Tip
========
Typing “step” or “next” a lot of times can be tedious. If you just press ENTER, gdb will repeat the same command you just gave it.

Theory3:
Different ways to pass command line arguments
==============================================

You can run gdb with --args parameter,

$ gdb --args executablename arg1 arg2 arg3

========================

$ gdb ./a.out

(gdb) r arg1 arg2 arg3

=======================

Theory4:
Debugging Segmentation Fault Example
=====================================

The first step is to compile the program with debugging flags:

$ gcc -g source_code.c

$ gdb ./a.out

We'll just run it and see what happens:

(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/panther2/Linux_System_Prog/day3_debugging/gdb/4/a.out 
hello

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__GI__IO_getline_info (fp=fp@entry=0x7ffff7dd4640 <_IO_2_1_stdin_>, buf=buf@entry=0x0, n=1022, delim=delim@entry=10, 
    extract_delim=extract_delim@entry=1, eof=eof@entry=0x0) at iogetline.c:86
86	iogetline.c: No such file or directory.


So we received the SIGSEGV signal from the operating system. This means that we tried to access an invalid memory address

(gdb) backtrace
The command backtrace (or bt) will show you the current function call stack, with the current function at the top, and the callers in order beneath it:


(gdb) bt
#0  __GI__IO_getline_info (fp=fp@entry=0x7ffff7dd4640 <_IO_2_1_stdin_>, buf=buf@entry=0x0, n=1022, delim=delim@entry=10, 
    extract_delim=extract_delim@entry=1, eof=eof@entry=0x0) at iogetline.c:86
#1  0x00007ffff7a80368 in __GI__IO_getline (fp=fp@entry=0x7ffff7dd4640 <_IO_2_1_stdin_>, buf=buf@entry=0x0, n=<optimized out>, 
    delim=delim@entry=10, extract_delim=extract_delim@entry=1) at iogetline.c:38
#2  0x00007ffff7a7f206 in _IO_fgets (buf=0x0, n=<optimized out>, fp=0x7ffff7dd4640 <_IO_2_1_stdin_>) at iofgets.c:56
#3  0x0000000000400634 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdfb8) at source_code.c:10

We are only interested in our own code here, so we want to switch to stack frame 3 and see where the program crashed:

(gdb) frame 3
#3  0x0000000000400634 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdfb8) at source_code.c:10
10		fgets(buf, 1024, stdin);

We crashed inside the call to fgets.
So the problem must be one of our arguments

(gdb) print buf
$1 = 0x0

The value of buf is 0x0, which is the NULL pointer. 
malloc returns NULL when it cannot allocate the amount of memory requested. So our malloc must have failed. 

=======================
Print Source Code In GDB Console
======================

(gdb) list
prints 10 lines of source code at a time

You can also pass the list command <a line number> or <a function name> to tell GDB where to start.

Display Lines After A Line Number
(gdb) list 12

Display Lines After A Function
(gdb) list main

Display Lines 1 to 14
(gdb) list 1,14

Theory5:
Displaying Data
======================

You can use print command to display the value of variables and other expressions

The print or p command takes any C expression as its argument:

p [/format] [expression]

(gdb) print i

(gdb) print &i

(gdb) print sizeof(i)

(gdb) print sizeof(&i)


Gdb comes with a powerful tool for directly examing memory: the x command. 

The x command examines memory, starting at a particular address. 

(gdb) x &i
0x7fffffffdedc:	0x00000539

It comes with a number of formatting commands that provide precise control over 
	how many bytes you’d like to examine and 
	how you’d like to print them

(gdb) x/4xb &i
0x7fffffffdedc:	0x39	0x05	0x00	0x00

The flags indicate that I want to examine 4 values
	formatted as he'x' numerals, one 'b'yte at a time

on Intel machines, bytes are stored in “little-endian” order

Examining types with ptype
============================

It tells you the type of a C expression

(gdb) ptype i
type = int

(gdb) ptype &i
type = int *

(gdb) ptype main
type = int ()

(gdb) print a
$2 = {1, 2, 3}

(gdb) ptype a
type = int [3]

use x to see what a looks like under the hood

(gdb) x/12xb &a
0x7fffffffded0:	0x01	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x02	0x00	0x00	0x00
0x7fffffffded8:	0x03	0x00	0x00	0x00

The first four bytes store a[0], the next four store a[1], and the final four store a[2]. 

Indeed, you can check that sizeof knows that a’s size in memory is twelve bytes:

(gdb) print sizeof(a)
$3 = 12
