File ownership
===============

Every file is owned by a specific user (or UID) and a specific group (or GID). 

The chown command can be used to change just the user, or the user and group of a file. 

The basic format for the chown command is as follows:

# chown user:group filename

Here is an example of changing the owner of file test to user and its group to user.

# chown user:user test

A period (.) can be used in place of the colon (:) separator character.

Also, either the user or group name can be omitted.
