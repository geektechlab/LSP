File Permissions
====================

All files and directories in Linux have a standard set of access permissions.

These access permissions control who can access what files, and provides a fundamental level of security to the files and directories in a system.

Linux divides authorization into 2 levels.

	Ownership
	Permission


Ownership of Linux files
===========================

Every file and directory on your Unix/Linux system is assigned 3 types of owner,

User:
===========

	The username of the person who owns the file/directory.

	By default, the user who creates the file/directory will become its owner.

Group:
============

	A user- group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will have the same access permissions to the file. 

Other:
=============

	Any other user who has access to a file. 

	 This person has neither created the file, nor he belongs to a usergroup who could own the file. 

	Practically, it means everybody else. 

Permissions
=================

Every file and directory in your UNIX/Linux system has following 3 permissions defined for all the 3 owners 

	Read:
		For a file, the read permission means the file can be opened and read.

		For a directory, the read permission means the user can list the contents of the directory.


	Write:

		For a file, write permission means the user can modify the file, and write new data to the file.

		For a directory, the write permission means the user is allowed to modify the content of the directory. The user can add, remove or rename files belongs to the particular directory.


	Execute:

		For a file, execute permission means the user can execute the file as a program or a shell script

		For a directory, the execute permission allows the user to access files in the directory and enter it, with the cd command but you are not allowed to list the content.


Viewing Permissions
====================

You can view the permission of the current directory by typing the following command

$ ls -l

Identifying Permissions
========================

r = read permission
w = write permission
x = execute permission
- = no permission

Linux has given values for the above permissions for the ease of use as below.

r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
