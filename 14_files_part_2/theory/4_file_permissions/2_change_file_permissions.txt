File Permissions
=========================

The chmod command is used to alter the permissions of a file.

There are 2 ways to use the chmod command:


Method #1: Relative method
=============================

Using characters to add (+), remove (-) or set (=)

Permissions for user(u), same group members(g), other group members(o), or all (i.e. ugo).

(e.g. chmod g+rw filename, chmod go=rx filename, chmod u+x,g=x filename )

Method #2: Absolute method
==========================

Using octal numbers as a shortcut to represent permissions set for user, group and others.

(eg. chmod 755 filename, chmod 644 filename )

The Absolute chmod command is a convenient “short-cut” to changing file and directory access permissions provided that you are comfortable converting octal and binary numbers.
