When you log into your UNIX system, you provide a username and a password at the login prompt.

The login(1) program looks up that username in a database and obtains your registered password.

It encrypts the password you supply at login and compares it to the one that is registered.

If they are equal, the login(1) program lets you pass in peace.

Once you are logged in, however, you become just a number to the UNIX kernel. 

This user ID number simplifies user and security management for the kernel.

In addition to logging in with a user ID, you log in with a group ID.

How to find out User ID Number of your user?
===============================================

To find out what user ID number you are, the id(1) command can be used:

$ id
uid=1000(panther2) gid=1000(panther2) groups=1000(panther2),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lpadmin),124(sambashare)

The id(1) command indicates that the user panther2 is user ID number 100 and is a member of group number 1000.

The user and group names are shown in brackets. These were obtained by looking up the user ID and group ID numbers in the password and group file databases, respectively.
