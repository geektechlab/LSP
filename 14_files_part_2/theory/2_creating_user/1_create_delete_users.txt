Creating and deleting users
===============================

Linux is a multi-user system which means that more than one person can interact with the same system at the same time. 

User creation is handled with the useradd command.

Syntax:

useradd [OPTIONS] USERNAME

$ sudo useradd -m user1

$ sudo useradd -m user2

-m option  creates a home directory

To add a password to user

$ sudo passwd user1

To delete the user account

$ sudo userdel -r user1

-r option - delete the userâ€™s home directory and mail spool

----
entries for all users and passwords are stored in [ cat /etc/passwd ]
----
[ su <username> ] switches to user because su=switch user
----
[ su ] becomes root user
