For example, you have a directory that needs to be accessed with 
	owner can have read/write permissions
	only read permissions for another group.

You need to create two users with usernames:

	user1

	user2

You need to create group:

	readers

user2 needs to be a member of the group readers

The group readers needs to only have read permission to the directory /DATA

the user needs to have both read and write permission to the /DATA directory

Step1: Create the users
=======================

$ sudo useradd -m user1

$ sudo useradd -m user2

$ sudo passwd user1 

$ sudo passwd user2

Step2: Creating Group
=======================

$ sudo groupadd readers

Step3: Add users to groups
==========================

$ sudo usermod -a -G readers user2

Step4: Directory
=================

$ mkdir data

$ sudo chown -R :readers data

$ sudo chmod -R g+r data

$ sudo chmod -R o-xw data
