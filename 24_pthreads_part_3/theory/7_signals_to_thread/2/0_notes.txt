Per-thread signal masks
============================

Like a traditional process, a thread has a signal mask that indicates which asynchronous signals it's willing to handle (these are considered unblocked) and which ones it's not (these are considered blocked). 

threads inherit the signal mask of the thread that issued the pthread_create that created them.

Use the pthread_sigmask call to block and unblock signals in the mask. 

When an asynchronously generated signal arrives at a process, it is handled once by exactly one thread in the process. 

The system selects this thread by referring to the collection of per-thread signal masks of all the threads.  If more than one thread has the signal unblocked, the system arbitrarily selects one of them.
