Thread Cancellation
==========================

Cancellation allows one thread to terminate another. 

One reason you may want to cancel a thread is to save system resources (such as CPU time) when your program determines that the thread's activity is no longer necessary.

A simple example of a thread you might want to cancel would be a thread performing a read-only data search. If one thread returns the results you are looking for, all other threads running the same routine could be canceled.

When we want to terminate a thread, we can use the pthread_cancel function.

This function gets a thread ID as a parameter, and sends a cancellation request to this thread. It will only sends request, doesn't cancel.

int pthread_cancel(pthread_t thread);

The target thread when it recives a cancellation request the reaction depends on the 2 attributes.
        1. state
        2. type

1. state :
                pthread_setcancelstate(int state, int *oldstate);

                This function sets the cancelability state of the calling thread to the given value in the state,
    the previous state of the thread is returned in the buffer pointed by old state.

    The value of the state can be PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, PHTREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE

    The default value is PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE.

2. type:
            pthread_setcanceltype(int type, int *oldtype);

            This function sets

                        .
    the type values can be PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
    The default option is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED.
            It means the cancellation request is deferred until the thread calls a function that is a cancellation point.
    PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
            Threads can be cancel at any time upon receiving the cancellation request.

    what is CANCELLATION_POINT ?
    ---------------------------
            They are certain functions which posix standard defines to allow the thread to be cancelled.
                man pthreads ->cancellation points

    Pthread provides user specific cancellation point :
                pthread_testcancel()
