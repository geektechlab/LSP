The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures.  
It is commonly mounted at `/proc`.  Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be changed.

If you list the contents of your /proc directory, you will probably see a lot of files.

We will focus on two of them:

	/proc/[pid]/mem : This file can be used to access the pages of a process's memory through open(2), read(2), and lseek(2).
	/proc/[pid]/maps :  A  file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access permissions.

find process id and then run [ cd /proc/<process id> ]
and then run [ cat maps ] and check heap and stack etc. addresses
