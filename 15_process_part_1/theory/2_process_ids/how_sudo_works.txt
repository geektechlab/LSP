How Sudo Works
=============

If you take a look at the executable sudo:

linuxtrainer@ubuntu:~$ which sudo
/usr/bin/sudo
linuxtrainer@ubuntu:~$ ls -la /usr/bin/sudo
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 149080 Jan 17  2018 /usr/bin/sudo
linuxtrainer@ubuntu:~$ 

You'll notice that it has the setuid bit set

Whenever you run a program with sudo, the sudo process runs with a root privilege straight away.
