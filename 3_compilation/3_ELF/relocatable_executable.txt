Difference between Relocatable Code and Machine Executable Code
================================================================

1. Instructions of Relocatable Code are bound to offset address assigned as per the position of the instruction within the procedure
Eg. 00000000 <main>
    0:  55  push %ebp
Executable binary code bounds to platform specific load address
Eg. 0804312d <main>
    0804312d:   55  push %ebp

2. Function call instructions in relocatable object files referred to called functions offset position
Eg. call 12 <main+0x12>
Call instructions in executable binaries referred to functions base address
Eg. call 8048300<printf@plt>

3. Relocatable object files only contains instructions that appear in the source file
Machine Executable code contains functionality plus run time code.

----------------
Linux generated executable will not work on Windows even if machine architecture is same. Because, Linux executable file format is ELF but Windows executable file format is COFF.
