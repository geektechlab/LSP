-Wall
============

The option -Wall enables all compilerâ€™s warning messages. This option is recommended to generate better code.

--save-temps
==============

We know our C Code goes through four stages: Preprocessing, compiling, assembling and linking
gcc creates many intermediate files for each stage
By default gcc deletes these intermediate files. 
You can instruct gcc to avoid deleting intermediate files passing '--save-temps' option to it. So, it will save all these files and won't delete those.

-g
================

Adds debugging symbols
