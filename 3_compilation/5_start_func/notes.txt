Writing program without main()
=================================

Now we know how the call to the main() is made.

As _start() function by default calls main(), we have to change it if we want to execute our custom startup code. 

We can override the _start() function to make it call our custom startup code not main(). 

$ gcc -nostartfiles -o nomain nomain.c

Now we have to force compiler to not use its own implementation of _start().In GCC we can do this using -nostartfiles
