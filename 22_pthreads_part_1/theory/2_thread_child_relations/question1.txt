what are some ways of handling the return value?

as return value can never be a stack variable, there are two ways of handling the return variable.
    i) create a struct and pass it the pthread_create() function itself, which the thread function will fill it before exiting the  function.
   ii) use a global variable to pass the return value.
  iii) pass a specific location to the thread that is created detached, and let the main thread use the return value, when suits.
