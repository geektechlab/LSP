-A: Select all processes; identical to -e 

-L: Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns

The main thread, by invoking pthread_exit(3), has exited before the other threads in the process; the Linux kernel thus marks it as a zombie.

How to prevent the main thread from becoming zombie?
======================================================

The answer is straightforward: do not allow the main thread to terminate before the other threads in the application; 

in other words, the recommendation is to always keep main() alive, waiting for all the other threads to die, before it itself terminates (and thus the process terminates).
