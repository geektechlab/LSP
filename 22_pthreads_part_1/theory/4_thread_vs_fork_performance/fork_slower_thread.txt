Why is fork slower than thread
===============================

Linux makes heavy use of the performance-enhancing copy-on-write(COW) memory techniques within its internal implementation of fork(2). 

Thus, it begs the question, if COW is heavily used, then what is slowing the fork down? 

The short answer: 
	page table creation and setup cannot be COW-ed; it takes a while to do. 
	When creating threads of the same process, this work (page table setup) is completely skipped.
