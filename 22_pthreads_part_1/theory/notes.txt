What is a thread?
=====================

A thread is a sequence of instructions within a process that can be executed independently of other code. 

Multiple threads within one process share
	Heap
	Data 
	Code
	open files (descriptors)
	signals and signal handlers
	current working directory
	User and group id

Each thread will have its own
	Thread ID
	set of registers, stack pointer
	stack for local variables, return addresses
	signal mask
	priority

Advantages of Threads
======================

--->	Useful when you want to make a program appear to do two things at once
	E.g. Real time word count on a document while still editing the text. One thread can manage the user's input and perform editing. The other thread will continuously update a word count variable

--->	Better utilization of hardware resources
	We have laptops and desktops containing CPU's with multiple cores, using multiple threads inside a process can better utilize the hardware resources.

--->	Context switch between threads is faster when compared to the context switch between processes ( add reason from Divy's message )

Drawbacks of Threads
=====================

--->	We should carefully design multithreaded programs as most of the resources of the process are shared

--->	Debugging a multithreaded program is much, much harder than debugging a single-thread program.
