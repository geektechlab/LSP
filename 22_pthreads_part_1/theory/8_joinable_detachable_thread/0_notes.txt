With every thread some resources are associated like stack  etc

When a thread exits ideally these resources should be reclaimed by process automatically. But that doesnâ€™t happens always. It depends on which mode thread is running.

A Thread can run in two modes i.e.

	Joinable Mode
	Detached Mode

By default a thread runs in joinable mode. Joinable thread will not release any resource even after the end of thread function, until some other thread calls pthread_join() with its ID.

A Detached thread automatically releases it allocated resources on exit. No other thread needs to join it. 

But by default all threads are joinable, so to make a thread detached we need to call pthread_detach() with thread id
