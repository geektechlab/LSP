/home
=========================
	Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
	For example, if your user name is bob, you have a home folder located at /home/bob
	Each user only has write access to their own home folder and must obtain elevated permissions (become the root user) 
	to modify other files on the system.

	[ echo $HOME ] gives path of home folder for a user
	if we become root by su or sudo -s command the  above command will display root home folder.

/root
============================
	Home directory of root user

/lib
===============
	Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.
	/lib/modules -- All loadable kernel modules are stored in this directory. 

/lib<qual> (lib32, lib64 etc)
==================
	32bit, 64 bit libs of the same name
	A 64-bit system may have compatibility for 32-bit binary.

/media
================
	media directory is where external storage will be automatically mounted when you plug it in and try to access it
	For example, when you insert a CD into your Linux system, a directory will automatically be created inside the /media directory. 

/mnt
===============
	A directory for temporarily mounted filesystems.
	For example, if youre mounting a Windows partition to perform some file recovery operations, you might mount it at /mnt/windows.
	Eg. iso files
