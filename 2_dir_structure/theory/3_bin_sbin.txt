/bin folder
===================

--> bin stands for binary which means an executable file

--> This folder contains commands or scripts or executable which can be executed to accomplish a task. 

--> There are several other directories on that also contain the string 'bin' in their names

	/bin	
	/sbin	
	/usr/bin	
	/usr/sbin	
	/usr/local/bin	
	/usr/local/sbin

/bin 
==========

	--> The /bin directory contains binaries for use by all users.

	--> /bin contains executables which are required by the system for emergency repairs, booting, and single user mode

	-->	This folder contains basic commands such as cat, chmod, chgrp, chown, date, dir, dd, df, ln, mv, echo

/sbin
==========

	--> stands for system binaries or super user binaries

	--> It contains commands that need to be available at the very beginning of the OS initialization and at the shutdown end too.

	--> This folder contains commands which are required for changing system properties or system level settings such as disk management, network management etc

	--> Many of the system binaries require root privilege to perform certain tasks.

	--> e.g. fsck, root, init, ifconfig

------------------

/usr is generally for user / administrator added binaries

sudo apt-get install gimp

we can chech by [ which gimp ] and it will show in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin

/usr/bin
================

	--> This folder is similar to /bin.

	--> Most programs executed by normal users which are not needed for booting or for repairing the system

	--> commands which are not installed locally should be placed in this directory

	--> Eg. vi, atq, bc, awk, cal, cmp, dig, diff, du, env, find, free, ftp, gcc, groups, id, info iostat, last, lsof, md5sum, nmap, rar, seq, tail, top

/usr/sbin
===============

	--> contains non-vital system utilities that are used after booting (i.e., starting the system) by the system administrator

	-->Eg.  adduser, chroot, groupadd, grub related commands, tcpdump

	--> /usr/sbin also contains some daemons, which are programs that run silently in the background
	
	--> Eg. bluetoothd, dropbear

------------------------

/usr/local is a place where files built by the system administrator are placed , typically by running following sequence on the source code

	1. ./configure
	2. make
	3. make install

Example: hello package

/usr/local/bin
====================
	
	Binaries for programs local to the site.

/usr/local/sbin
===================
	
	Locally installed programs for system administration
