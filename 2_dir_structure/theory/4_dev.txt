/dev 
====================

	dev -- device
		Linux/Unix treat everything as files.
		it treats hardware devices too as files. All hardware files are present in /dev(Device ) folder.
		Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null.
		Many of these are generated at boot time or even on the fly

	For example if you plug in a new webcam or a USB Pendrive into your machine, a new device entry will be automatically created here

	In Linux, most devices are either character devices or block devices. 

	Character devices can be thought of as those that transfer data in characters or bytes. character devices transfer data in bytes/characters. eg. serial port/printer port.
	For example:
		/dev/lp0 represents the first printer port
		/dev/ttyS0 represents the first serial port

	Block devices are those that transmit data in multiple blocks at a time. Any device transferring data in block is block devices. e.g. hard disk, SCSI, pen drives etc.
		/dev/hd* represents hard disk drives.
		/dev/sd* represents SCSI devices

---------------
if [ ls -l ] gives b inside /dev directory for any device then block, if gives c then character device.

	There are some other very interesting device files in /dev. 
	The device files null, zero, random and urandom are not associated with any physical devices.

	/dev/zero: Used by developers to create a file with no meaningful data but a particular size
	e.g. [ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zero.txt bs=1024 count=1 ] will create file of size 1kB
	e.g. [ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zero.txt bs=1024 count=1024 ] will create file of size 1MB
	we can verify file size using [ ls -lh ] and content using [ od ] command.

	/dev/null: Used by developers for redirecting unwanted output/error etc to this file. Useful for creating files with zero size. it is a kind of black hole.

	/dev/null
	Read : Returns End of file (read returns 0)
	Write: Data written is discarded

	/dev/zero:
	Read: Returns endless bytes of zeroes (\0 characters)
	Write: Data written is discarded


	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zero.txt bs=4096 count=1000
	dd if=/dev/null of=/tmp/null.txt bs=4096 count=1000

	Notice the byte count.

	Use cases of /dev/zero and /dev/null

	1. Suppressing stdout : $ cat file > /dev/null or $ cat file > /dev/zero
	2. Deleting the contents of the file : $ cat /dev/null > /tmp/file
	3. Destroying existing data on the file system partition : $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<destination partition>
	4. Creating a 1 MB file: $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/file count=1024 bs=1024
