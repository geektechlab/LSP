/etc Everything to configure
===================================
	Contains system-wide configuration files.
	Contains configuration files required by all programs.	
	This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.

	Example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf. [ cat /etc/passwd ]
	/etc/hostname -- Contains the hostname of your machine 

	/etc/modules -- List of modules to be loaded at startup.

	/etc/hosts -- The hosts file is used to map hostname to IP Address

	/etc/fstab -- this file automatically mounts filesystems that are spread across multiple drives or separate partitions.
				This file is checked when the system boots and filesystems are mounted. During boot, kernel reads this file and mounts all filesystem listed here.
				e.g. [ cat /etc/fstab ] and the verify same UUID using [ blkid /dev/<filesystem> ]

	/etc/passwd - user details
