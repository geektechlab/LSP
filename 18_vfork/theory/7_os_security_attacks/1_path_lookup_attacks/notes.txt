Path Lookup Attacks: Where the attacker leverages path lookup to compromise an executable or library

when we are in the shell and type a command:

$ cat helloworld.txt
Hello World

The command cat is run, but the program that is actually cat's the file exists in a different place in the file system

We can find that location using the which command:

$ which cat
/bin/cat

So when we type cat, we are really executing /bin/cat which is found by exploring the PATH enviroment variable:

echo $PATH
/home/panther2/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
Each of the directories listed is searched, in order, until that command is found. 

Environment variables are global variables set across programs that provide information about the current environment.

The PATH variable is a perfect example of this, and the customizability of the environment variables. 

What if I add a custom location containing my binaries in the starting of the PATH environmental variable ?
