How do we fix this? There are two solutions:

1. Always use full paths. Don't specify a command to run by its name, instead describe exactly which program is to be executed.

2. Fix the path before executing using setenv()

You can actually control the current PATH setting during execution. To do this you can set the environment variables using setenv() and getenv()
