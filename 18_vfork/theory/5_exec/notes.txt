Key points during an exec operation
=======================================

---> The successor process overwrites (or overlays) the predecessor's virtual address space.  
	In effect, the predecessor's text, data, library, and stack segments are now replaced by that of the successor's. 
	The OS will take care of the size adjustments.

---> No new process has been created - the successor runs in the context of the old predecessor
	Several predecessor attributes (including but not limited to the PID and open files) thus get auto-inherited by the successor.

---> On a successful exec, there is no possibility of returning to the predecessor; it's gone.
