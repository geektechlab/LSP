1. Fire up a shell
2. In the window, or more precisely, at the shell prompt, type this: 
$ exec ps

Yes, the terminal window process is the predecessor here; upon an exec it's overwritten by the successor process ps, which does its work and exits (you probably did not see the output as it disappeared too quickly).

ps is the successor process, and, of course, we cannot return to the predecessor (the Terminal window)â€”ps has literally replaced its VAS. Thus, the Terminal window effectively disappears.
