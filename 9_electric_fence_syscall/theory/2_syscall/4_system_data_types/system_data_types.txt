C Data Types
==============

Common data types used in C:
	char
	int
	float
	double

System Data Types
======================

Historically, certain C data types have been associated with certain UNIX system variables.

	For example, major and minor device numbers have historically been stored in a 16-bit short integer, with 8 bits for the major device number and 8 bits for the minor device number.

	the 32-bit version of Solaris uses 32 bits for the device number: 14 bits for the major and 18 bits for the minor

The header <sys/types.h>  defines some implementation-dependent data types, called the primitive system data types. More of these data types are defined in other headers as well. 

These data types are defined in the headers with the C typedef facility. Most end in _t.

By defining these data types this way, we do not build into our programs implementation details that can change from one system to another

clock_t counter of clock ticks (process time) 
comp_t compressed clock ticks 
dev_t device numbers (major and minor)
fd_set file descriptor sets 
fpos_t file position 
gid_t numeric group IDs
ino_t i-node numbers
mode_t file type, file creation mode 
nlink_t link counts for directory entries 
off_t file sizes and offsets (signed) (lseek)
pid_t process IDs and process group IDs (signed)
pthread_t thread IDs 
ptrdiff_t result of subtracting two pointers (signed)
rlim_t resource limits 
sig_atomic_t data type that can be accessed atomically 
sigset_t signal set 
size_t sizes of objects (such as strings) (unsigned) 
ssize_t functions that return a count of bytes (signed) (read, write)
time_t counter of seconds of calendar time 
uid_t numeric user IDs
wchar_t can represent all distinct character codes

generally, anything ending with _t is system data type.
