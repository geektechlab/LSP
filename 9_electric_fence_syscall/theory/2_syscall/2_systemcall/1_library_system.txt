Library functions vs. System Calls
========================================

Standard functions can be divided in two main categories :-
	1. Library function calls.
	2. System function calls.

The functions which are a part of standard C library are known as Library functions.
E.g. strcmp(), strlen()

The functions which change the execution mode of the program from user mode to kernel mode are known as system calls
E.g. socket(), open(), read() , write()

A library function is linked to the user program and executes in user space but a system call is not linked to a user program and executes in kernel space.

-----
how to find if given given function is library call or system call ?
if we do [ man printf ] and we see 1, it means it is executable.

we can run [ man man ] to find section numbers and what they corresponds to. We can see 2 is for system call and 3 is for library calls.
----
we can check [ man 3 printf ] and it is library call.
