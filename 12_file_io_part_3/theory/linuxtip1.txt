How to Run Multiple Commands at once in Linux
==============================================

Combining two or more commands on the command line is also known as “command chaining”.

It is used to increase productivity.

Option One: The Semicolon (;) Operator
=======================================

pwd ; ls -l ; whoami

In this case the second command will run regardless of whether the first command is successful or not

You don’t have to put spaces between the semicolons and the commands, either.

Option Two: Logical AND (&&) operator
=======================================

mkdir linux && cd linux

The second command will run only when the first command is successful. Exit status of the first command should be 0.

You can verify the exit status by $?

Option Three: Logical OR (||) operator
=======================================

pwd || ls -l

The second command will run only when the first command is failed

ping -c1 www.google.com > /dev/null || echo “Problem with your network, Please connect to Network Administrator”
