F_DUPFD
=================

Duplicate the file descriptor fd.

The new file descriptor is returned as the value of the function.

It is the lowest-numbered descriptor that is not already open, and that is greater than or equal to the third argument (taken as an integer).

The new descriptor shares the same file table entry as fd.

The dup() function provides an alternative interface to the service provided by fcntl() using the F_DUPFD command. The call dup(fildes) shall be equivalent to:

fcntl(fildes, F_DUPFD, 0);
