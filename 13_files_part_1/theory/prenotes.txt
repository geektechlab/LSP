Inodes
========================

In Linux everything is treated as a file. (even the hardware devices)

The keyboard, mouse, printers, monitor, hard disk, processes, even the directories are treated as files in Linux. 

The regular files contain data such as text (text files), music, videos (multimedia files) etc. 

Set aside the regular data, there are some other data about these files, such as their size, ownership, permissions, timestamp etc.

This meta-data about a file is managed with a data structure known as an inode (index node).

What is an inode in Linux?
=================================

Every Linux file or directory has an inode, and this inode contains all of the fileâ€™s metadata

For example, the inode contains
	a list of all the blocks in which a file is stored
	the owner information for that file,
	permissions
	and all other attributes that are set for the file.

In a sense, you could say that a file really is the inode, and names are attached to these inodes to make it easier for humans to work with them.

Inode Number
==========================

An inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as ext3 or ext4. 

Linux extended filesystems such as ext2 or ext3 maintain an array of these inodes: the inode table.

This table contains list of all files in that filesystem.

The individual inodes in inode table have a unique number (unique to that filesystem), the inode number.

an inode stores:

File type: regular file, directory, pipe etc.
Permissions to that file: read, write, execute
Link count: The number of hard link relative to an inode
User ID: owner of file
Group ID: group owner
Size of file: or major/minor number in case of some special files
Time stamp: access time, modification time and (inode) change time
Attributes: immutable' for example
Access control list: permissions for special users/groups
Link to location of file
Other metadata about the file

Note that inode does not store name of the file but its content only.

You can display the inode data on a file or directory by using stat command. You need to indicate the name of the file.

----
we can run [ man stat ]. stat can takefile and folder both as input.

Where are filenames stored on a filesystem?
============================================

inodes do not contain file names, only other file metadata.

the name of the file is stored within the directories' information structure

directories are special files that are used to create and hold access paths to the files in the file system.

A directory file is a list of directory entries, each one containing the following information:

inode - The inode for this directory entry. This is an index into the array of inodes held in the Inode Table of the Block Group.

name length - The length of this directory entry in bytes,

name - The name of this directory entry.

The first two entries for every directory are always the standard . and .. entries meaning "this directory" and "the parent directory" respectively.
