int fstatat(int fd, const char *restrict pathname,struct stat *restrict buf, int flag);

The fstatat function provides a way to return the file statistics for a pathname relative to an open directory represented by the fd argument.

The flag argument controls whether symbolic links are followed;

when the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flag is set, fstatat will not follow symbolic links, but rather returns information about the link itself.

Otherwise, the default is to follow symbolic links, returning information about the file to which the symbolic link points

If the fd argument has the value AT_FDCWD and the pathname argument is a relative pathname

If the pathname argument is an absolute pathname, then the fd argument is ignored. In these two cases, fstatat behaves like either stat or lstat, depending on the value of flag.
