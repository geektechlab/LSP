Soft Link
======================

The basic command structure for creating a soft link is:

ln -s <SOURCE> <LINK>

SOURCE is the original file

LINK is the new file you will create that will point to the original source.

The primary difference between hard and symbolic link creation, is that you use the -s option. 

Example:

$ touch file.txt

$ echo "hello world" > file.txt

$ ls -li

$ ln -s file.txt soft_file.txt

$ ls -li

Important Points
=====================

1. Soft Links will have different inode number, file size are different and permissions are also different ( verify it by [ ls -li <filename> ], first number is inode ? ).

2. Soft link contains the path to the original file and not the contents

3. Removing soft link doesn't affect anything, but when the original file is removed, the link becomes a 'dangling' link that points to nonexistent file

4. Soft link can link to a directory

5. Symbolic links can span file systems as they are simply the name of another file.

-------
- when creating a dynamic library, we create soft link. so it be thought as pointer to a file.
- hard link can be used for backup.
