stat
=================

#include <sys/stat.h>
int stat(const char *restrict pathname, struct stat *restrict buf );

Given a pathname, the stat function returns a structure of information about the named file

struct stat {
	mode_t st_mode; /* file type & mode (permissions) */
	ino_t st_ino; /* i-node number (serial number) */
	dev_t st_dev; /* device number (file system) */
	dev_t st_rdev; /* device number for special files */
	nlink_t st_nlink; /* number of links */
	uid_t st_uid; /* user ID of owner */
	gid_t st_gid; /* group ID of owner */
	off_t st_size; /* size in bytes, for regular files */
	struct timespec st_atim; /* time of last access */
	struct timespec st_mtim; /* time of last modification */
	struct timespec st_ctim; /* time of last file status change */
	blksize_t st_blksize; /* best I/O block size */
	blkcnt_t st_blocks; /* number of disk blocks allocated */
};

The timespec structure type defines time in terms of seconds and nanoseconds. It
includes at least the following fields:
time_t tv_sec;
long tv_nsec;

The biggest user of the stat functions is probably the ls -l command, to learn all the information about a file

----
we can verify it by running [ strace ls -l ].
