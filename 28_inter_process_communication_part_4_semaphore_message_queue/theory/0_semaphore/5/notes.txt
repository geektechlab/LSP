Unnamed Semaphores
========================

#include <semaphore.h>

int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value);

The sem_init() function initializes the unnamed semaphore specified by the sem argument and assigns that semaphore the value specified by the value argument.

Once the semaphore has been successfully initializes, you can use it in subsequent calls to sem_wait and sem_post

Semaphores created with sem_init() should only be destroyed with the sem_destroy() function 

pshared -- a value of zero means semaphore is shared between threads
           a value of non zero means sempahore is shared between processes.
