Semaphores
=================

Semaphores are used for process and thread synchronization.

A  semaphore  is an integer whose value is never allowed to fall below zero.

Two operations can be performed on semaphores:
	increment the semaphore value by one (sem_post(3))
	and  decrement  the  semaphore value by one (sem_wait(3))

If the value of a semaphore is currently zero, then a sem_wait(3) operation will block until the value becomes greater than zero.

Types of Semaphores
--------------------

There are two types of POSIX semaphores
	named
	unnamed

Named
=============
Named semaphores have a name, which is of the format /somename. The first character is a forward slash, followed by one or more characters, none of which is a slash. 

Programs using POSIX semaphores need to be linked with the pthread library.
