Sending  Message Queues
=======================================

Once a message queue is open, you can send messages to another process using the mq_send function.

int mq_send(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr,
                     size_t msg_len, unsigned int msg_prio);

The mq_send function takes four parameters, including: 
	the message queue descriptor, 
	a pointer to a message buffer, 
	the size of the buffer, and 
	the message priority


The read/write permissions are checked along with the length of the message, the status of the message queue, and the message flag.

If all checks are successful, the message is added to the message queue.

If the queue is already full, the sending process can block until space in the queue becomes available

it can return immediately, if we set the O_NONBLOCK flag when it called the mq_open function.
