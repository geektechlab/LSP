Receiving Messages
=====================

Once a message has been placed on a queue, you can retrieve the message with a call to the mq_receive function. 

ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr,
                          size_t msg_len, unsigned int *msg_prio);


The mq_receive function includes four parameters:
	the message queue descriptor,
	a pointer to a buffer to hold the incoming message,
	the size of the buffer,
	and the priority of the message received (the priority is returned by the function)

 The size of the buffer must be at least the size of the message queue's size attribute

When a process uses the mq_receive function to read a message from a queue, the queue may be empty. 

The receiving process can block until a message arrives in the queue, or it can return immediately, according to the state of the O_NONBLOCK flag established with a preceding call to the mq_open function.
