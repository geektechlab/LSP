Named Pipes vs Sockets
==========================

Duplex
	Stream sockets provide bi-directional communication while named pipes are uni-directional.

Distinct clients
	Clients using sockets each have an independent connection to the server.  
	With named pipes, many clients may write to the pipe, but the server cannot distinguish the clients from each other-- the server has only one descriptor to read from the named pipe.
	Since pipes have these limitations, UNIX domain sockets should be used if there are multiple clients that need to be distinguishable or which write long messages to the server.

Method of Creating and opening
	Sockets are created using socket and assigned their identity via bind. 
	Named pipes are created using mkfifo.
	To connect to a UNIX domain socket the normal socket/connect calls are used, but a named pipe is written using regular file open and write
	That makes them easier to use from a shell script for example.
