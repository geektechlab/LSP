Listening connections
======================

listen allow to accept incoming connections

#include <sys/socket.h>
int listen (int sockfd, int backlog);

Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error

	sockfd references the socket we want to affect

	backlog specifies the maximum number of pending connections that the socket will keep

	The backlog argument provides a hint to the implementation which the implementation shall use to limit the number of outstanding connections in the socket's listen queue.

Accepting connections
========================

#include <sys/socket.h>
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);

Returns: file descriptor on success, -1 on error
