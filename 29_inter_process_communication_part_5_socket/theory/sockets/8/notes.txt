socketpair()
===================
For bidirectional communication you need to call bind(), listen() and so many.

there's a beauty of a system call known as socketpair() this is nice enough to return to you a pair of already connected sockets! 

The pair of sockets is unnamed; that is, they are not bound to a file path.

No extra work is needed on your part; you can immediately use these socket descriptors for interprocess communication.

If you want two separate programs to communicate (eg. you have an executable called client, and one called server), you can't use this mechanism.
