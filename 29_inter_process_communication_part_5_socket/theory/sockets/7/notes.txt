Sockets are fairly configurable

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int getsockopt(int s, int level, int optname, void *optval,
               socklen_t *optlen);
int setsockopt(int s, int level, int optname, const void *optval,
               socklen_t optlen);

When getsockopt is invoked with the SO_PEERCRED option, it accepts the struct ucred structure as further parameter 
This structure has three elements: pid, uid and gid. 

After calling getsockopt with a pointer to this structure, these fields will contain the process, user and group ids of the party on the other end of the socket connection

What makes this call so important is that provides a clean and reliable way of establishing the identity of another process.
