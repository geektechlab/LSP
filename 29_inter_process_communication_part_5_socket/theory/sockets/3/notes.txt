Connecting
=================

#include <sys/socket.h>
int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);

Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error

	sockfd is your own socket, to be used as your endpoint of the connection
	addr/addrlen specify the well-known address of the peer you want to connect to, and are given in the same format of bind parameters
