Linux Abstract Socket Namespace
====================================

Linux has a special feature: if the pathname for a UNIX domain socket begins with a null byte \0, its name is not mapped into the filesystem

Thus it wonâ€™t collide with other names in the filesystem

Also, when a server closes its UNIX domain listening socket in the abstract namespace, its file is deleted

with regular UNIX domain sockets, the file persists after the server closes it.
