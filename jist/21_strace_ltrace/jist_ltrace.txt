Theory0:
ltrace is a debugging utility in Linux, used to display the calls a userspace application makes to shared libraries.

Its name itself comes from library-call tracing.

This tool is very useful for debugging user-space applications to determine which library call is failing.

ltrace ./executable <parameters>

Theory1:
$ ltrace <application> <application_parameters>

Theory2:
$ ltrace /bin/cat

ltrace(1) also allows you to selectively trace library calls when executed with the “-e” option and a set of calls to trace:

$ ltrace -e malloc /bin/cat

If you need to view the library calls from a live process, you can use ltrace(1)’s “-p” option:

$ ltrace -p 2644
The parameter -c outputs the number and duration of the library calls that have occurred

$ ltrace -c ls /
