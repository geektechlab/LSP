The main problem with this program is that, there is a time window, between unblocking of signal and pause, in which the signal can be received. 

sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK,&mask2,NULL);

//window in which the signal could be received 

pause();

To test this problem, send the SIGINT from the terminal before the critical section 1 ends, i.e. when the process is in sleep inside first critical section
