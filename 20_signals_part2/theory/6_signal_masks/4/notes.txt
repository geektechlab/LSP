#include <signal.h>

int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask);

sigsuspend() temporarily replaces the signal mask of the calling process with the mask given by mask and
then suspends the process until delivery of a signal whose action is to invoke a signal  handler  or  to
terminate a process.

In other words, the program is effectively suspended until one of the signals that is not a member of set arrives.
