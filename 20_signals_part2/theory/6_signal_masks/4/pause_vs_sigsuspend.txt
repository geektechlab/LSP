Pause vs Sigsuspend
======================

sigsuspend and pause, both do the same work, they pause or temporarily stops the process until they receive some signal. 

These functions return, once the signal handling of the signal is complete.

A small difference between these functions is that, in sigsuspend, we can specify the signal mask to which the function should not listen. 

Suppose we implement the sigsuspend in the following manner

sigset_t tempmask; sigemptyset(&tempmask); sigaddset(&tempmask,SIGINT); sigsuspend(&tempmask);

Now, in the above code, we have specified the sigsuspend function to listen for every signal except SIGINT.

When sigsuspend receives any other signal than SIGINT, it returns.
