The signal() function returns a pointer to the previous signal handler, which means that here, again, is a system call that we cannot error check in the typical way, by checking if the return value is less than 0. This is because a pointer type is unsigned, there is no such thing as negative pointers.

Instead, a special value is used SIG_ERR which we can compare the return value of signal().
