Can multiple signals be queued?
=================================

No - however it is possible to have signals that are in a pending state.

If a signal is pending, it means it has not yet been delivered to the process.

The most common reason for a signal to be pending is that the process (or thread) has currently blocked that particular signal.

If a particular signal, e.g. SIGINT, is pending then it is not possible to queue up the same signal again.

It is possible to have more than one signal of a different type in a pending state. For example SIGINT and SIGTERM signals may be pending (i.e. not yet delivered to the target process)
