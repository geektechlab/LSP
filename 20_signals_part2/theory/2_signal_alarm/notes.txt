A SIGALRM signal is delivered by the Operating System via a request from the user occuring after some amount of time.

To request an alarm, use the alarm() system call:

unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);

After seconds have passed since requesting the alarm(), the SIGALRM signal is delivered. 

The default behavior of SIGALRM is to terminate, so we can catch and handle the signal, leading to a nice hello world program

The pause() call will "pause" the program until a signal is delivered and handled. Pausing is an effective way to avoid busy waiting, e.g., while(1);, because the process is suspended during a pause and awoken following the return of the signal handler.
