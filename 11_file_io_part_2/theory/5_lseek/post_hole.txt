$ ./a.out
$ ls -l file.hole check its size
$ od -c file.hole let’s look at the actual contents

We use the od(1) command to look at the contents of the file
The -c flag tells it to print the contents as characters

To prove that there is really a hole in the file, let’s compare the file we just created with a file of the same size, but without holes:

$ ls -ls file.hole file.nohole
