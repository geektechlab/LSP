Every open file has an associated ‘‘current file offset,’’ normally a non-negative integer that measures the number of bytes from the beginning of the file

Read and write operations normally start at the current file offset and cause the offset to be incremented by the number of bytes read or written.

By default, this offset is initialized to 0 when a file is opened, unless the O_APPEND option is specified

An open file’s offset can be set explicitly by calling lseek.

#include <unistd.h>
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);

Returns: new file offset if OK, −1 on error

The interpretation of the offset depends on the value of the whence argument.

If whence is SEEK_SET, the file’s offset is set to offset bytes from the beginning of the file.

If whence is SEEK_CUR, the file’s offset is set to its current value plus the offset. The offset can be positive or negative.

If whence is SEEK_END, the file’s offset is set to the size of the file plus the offset. The offset can be positive or negative.

in nutshell,. lseek can be used to play with file's offset
