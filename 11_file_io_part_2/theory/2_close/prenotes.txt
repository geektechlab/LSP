An open file is closed by calling the close function.

#include <unistd.h>
int close(int fd);

Returns: 0 if OK, âˆ’1 on error

When a process terminates, all of its open files are closed automatically by the kernel.

-----
if we use buffered I/O then data will get lost if close is not used after opening. Unbuffered I/ it may be okay
