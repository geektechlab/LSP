Data is read from an open file with the read function.

#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t nbytes);

Returns: number of bytes read, 0 if end of file, âˆ’1 on error

If the read is successful, the number of bytes read is returned. If the end of file is encountered, 0 is returned

When reading from a regular file, if the end of file is reached before the requested number of bytes has been read. 

For example, if 30 bytes remain until the end of file and we try to read 100 bytes, read returns 30. The next time we call read, it will return 0 (end of file).
