why would I need to duplicate a file descriptor?
=================================================

The dup system call duplicates an existing file descriptor, returning a new one that refers to the same underlying I/O object.

Dup allows shells to implement commands like this:

ls existing-file non-existing-file > tmp1  2>&1

The 2>&1 tells the shell to give the command a file descriptor 2 that is a duplicate of descriptor 1. (i.e stderr & stdout point to same fd).

Now the error message for calling ls on non-existing file and the correct output of ls on existing file show up in tmp1 file.
