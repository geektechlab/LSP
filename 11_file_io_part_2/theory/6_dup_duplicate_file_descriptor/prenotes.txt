dup and dup2
==================
An existing file descriptor is duplicated by either of the following functions

#include <unistd.h>

int dup(int fd);
int dup2(int fd, int fd2);

Both return: new file descriptor if OK, âˆ’1 on error

The new file descriptor returned by dup is guaranteed to be the lowest-numbered available file descriptor.

fd doesn't get closed ? verify

With dup2, we can specify the value of the new descriptor of our choice with the fd2 argument. If fd2 is already open, it is first closed. If fd equals fd2, then dup2 returns fd2 without closing it.
