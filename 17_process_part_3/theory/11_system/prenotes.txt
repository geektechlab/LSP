system:
------
syntax:
int system(const char* cmd);

system() is used to invoke an o.s cmd from c/c++ program.

Using system(), we can execute any command that can be run on the terminal.

Return value:
-1  : Error
On success, the return value is the return status of the command as provided by wait(). 
Consequently, the exit code of the executed command is obtained via WEXITSTATUS.

The system call will fork, execute the command passed by parameter and the original parent process will wait for this to finish. This also means that system is a blocking call: The parent process can't continue until the process started by system exits. This may or may not be useful.
