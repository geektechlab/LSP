Shared Library Names
=======================

Linux shared library can have three names. Which are:

	Linker name (eg: libexample.so)
	Soname (eg : libexample.so.1.2)
	Real Name (eg : libexample.so.1.2.3)

Linker Name
==============

Linker Name is the name that is requested by the linker when another code is linked with your library (with â€“lexample linker option). 

Linker name typically starts with
	the prefix lib
	name of the library
	the phrase .so

soname
=============

Every shared library has a special name called the ``soname''.

The soname has 
	the prefix ``lib'', 
	the name of the library, 
	the phrase ``.so'', 
	followed by a period 
	and a version number that is incremented whenever the interface changes 

Eg. libarith.so.1

Real Name
=============

Real Name is the actual name of the shared library file. 

Real Name = soname + minor version number

Eg. libarith.so.1.0

It can also be libarith.so.1.0.1.3

During shared library installation
=====================================

soname is a symbolic link to the real name

linker name is a symbolic link to the soname

In this way both soname and linker names ultimately point to the real name of the library (i.e. actual library file).

--------------
To verify this,
do [ ldd hello ], then find shared lib ( libc.so.* ), then [ cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ ], then do [ ls libc.so.* ], you will find it is symbolic link.
--------------

--------------
symbolic link or symlink is similar to shortcut in Windows.
--------------

Command to read the soname from real name
============================
$ readelf -d libarith.so

-----------
[ ln -s ] can be used to create symbolic link.
