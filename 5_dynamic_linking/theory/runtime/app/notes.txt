Where do executables look for shared objects at runtime?
===========================================================

	directories listed in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

	directories listed in the executable's rpath;

	directories on the system search path, which (on Linux at least) consists of the entries in /etc/ld.so.conf plus /lib and /usr/lib

	export LD_DEBUG=all to see some more debug output from the loader

rpath
===========
	rpath designates the run-time search path hard-coded in an executable file

	$gcc main.c -o main -I.. -larith -L.. -Wl,-rpath=..

LD_LIBRARY_PATH
====================

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=..
