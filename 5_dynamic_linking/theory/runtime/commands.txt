How to create the dynamic library
===================================

Step1: Create object files using the below command

	$ gcc -fPIC -c *.c

the -fPIC flag stands for Position Independent Code, a characteristic required by shared libraries

Step2: Create the library

	$ gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libarith.so -o libarith.so *.o

The -shared key tells the compiler to produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.

-Wl flag passes an options to linker with following format -Wl,options
	in case of our example it sets the name of library, as it will be passed to the linker.


Use the dynamic library
=============================
$ cd app
$ gcc main.c -o main -I.. -larith -L..


Tools to work with dynamic library
===================================

To find out what functions a library has, use the nm command

$ nm libarith.so
